# FAQs:

How can I register as a farmer?
- Agri Farmer Connect offers the user the ability to register as a farmer via the registration page. 
  Select the "Become a Farmer" text on the top right next to "log in" and fill in all the required information. You must then await the approval of your farmer account.

Can farmers leave reviews for products?
- Currently, the platform does not support leaving reviews for products. However, this feature may be implemented in future updates.

Why can I not see the marketplace?
- The marketplace is a list of all the farmer's products made on the site. It is only available to approved farmers who have successfully logged into the system.
